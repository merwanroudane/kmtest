Description: Implements the Kobayashi-McAleer (1999) tests for choosing between 
    linear and logarithmic transformations of integrated time series processes. 
    The package provides four test statistics: V1 and V2 for processes with drift,
    and U1 and U2 for processes without drift. These tests help determine whether
    a time series should be modeled in levels or logarithms.
